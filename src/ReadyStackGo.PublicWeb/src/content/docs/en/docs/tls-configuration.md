description: Comprehensive guide to configuring HTTPS, certificates, and reverse proxy in ReadyStackGo
---

This guide explains all TLS configuration options in ReadyStackGo - from self-signed certificates through custom certificates to Let's Encrypt and reverse proxy scenarios.

## Overview

ReadyStackGo supports various TLS/HTTPS configurations:

| Option | Use Case | Complexity |
|--------|----------|------------|
| **Self-Signed** | Development, testing, internal network | No configuration needed |
| **Custom Certificate** | Corporate CA, purchased certificates | File upload |
| **Let's Encrypt** | Production environments with public domain | Domain validation |
| **Reverse Proxy** | Behind nginx, Traefik, HAProxy, etc. | Proxy-dependent |

All settings are located under **Settings → TLS / Certificates** in the Web UI.

---

## Self-Signed Certificate

### What is a self-signed certificate?

A self-signed certificate is automatically generated by ReadyStackGo on first start. It encrypts the connection but is not signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). Browsers will therefore show a security warning.

### When to use?

- **Local development** - Encryption without CA setup
- **Internal test systems** - When security warnings are acceptable
- **Docker development** - Quick start without certificate configuration

### How it works

1. On first start, ReadyStackGo checks if a certificate exists
2. If not, a self-signed certificate is automatically generated
3. The certificate is stored at `/app/config/tls/selfsigned.pfx`
4. Validity: 365 days

### Reset to self-signed certificate

If you've uploaded a custom certificate and want to switch back to self-signed:

1. Navigate to **Settings → TLS / Certificates**
2. Click **Configure Certificate**
3. Select **Reset to Self-Signed**
4. Confirm the action
5. **Restart ReadyStackGo** to load the new certificate

---

## Custom Certificate

### When to use?

- **Corporate CA** - Internal Certificate Authority
- **Purchased certificates** - From a public CA (DigiCert, Comodo, etc.)
- **Wildcard certificates** - One certificate for multiple subdomains

### Supported formats

ReadyStackGo accepts two certificate formats:

| Format | Files | Typical Source |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **PFX/PKCS#12** | Single .pfx/.p12 file with password | Windows export, IIS |
| **PEM** | Separate certificate and key files | Linux, OpenSSL, Let's Encrypt |

### Step-by-step: Upload PFX certificate

1. Navigate to **Settings → TLS / Certificates**
2. Click **Configure Certificate**
3. Select **Upload PFX Certificate**
4. Choose the .pfx file
5. Enter the password (if any)
6. Click **Upload**
7. **Restart ReadyStackGo**

:::tip[PFX without password]
If your PFX has no password, leave the password field empty.
:::

### Step-by-step: Upload PEM certificate

1. Navigate to **Settings → TLS / Certificates**
2. Click **Configure Certificate**
3. Select **Upload PEM Certificate**
4. Paste the certificate file content (starts with `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----`)
5. Paste the key file content (starts with `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` or `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`)
6. Click **Upload**
7. **Restart ReadyStackGo**

:::note[Certificate chain]
If you have a certificate chain (intermediate certificates), paste all certificates in the correct order in the certificate field: Server certificate first, then intermediate certificates.
:::

### Create certificate with OpenSSL

If you need a self-signed certificate with longer validity or specific settings:

```bash
# Generate key and certificate (10 years validity)
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 3650 -nodes \
  -subj "/CN=readystackgo.local"

# Convert to PFX (optional)
openssl pkcs12 -export -out certificate.pfx -inkey key.pem -in cert.pem
```

## Let's Encrypt

### What is Let's Encrypt?

Let's Encrypt is a free, automated Certificate Authority. The certificates are trusted by all major browsers and valid for 90 days. ReadyStackGo renews them automatically.

### Prerequisites

- **Publicly reachable domain** - Let's Encrypt must be able to validate your domain
- **DNS record** - The domain must point to your server
- **Port 80 or DNS access** - Depending on challenge type

### Challenge types

Let's Encrypt uses challenges to verify that you control the domain:

| Challenge | Requirement | Advantages |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **HTTP-01** | Port 80 reachable | Simplest setup |
| **DNS-01** | DNS access | Wildcard support, no port 80 needed |

### Step-by-step: HTTP-01 Challenge

This method is easiest when ReadyStackGo is directly reachable from the internet.

**Prerequisite:** Port 80 must point to your server (not just port 443).

1. Navigate to **Settings → TLS / Certificates**
2. Click **Configure Certificate**
3. Select **Let's Encrypt**
4. Enter the following data:
   - **Domains:** Your domain(s), e.g., `rsgo.example.com`
   - **Email:** For expiration notifications
   - **Challenge Type:** HTTP-01
5. Optional: Enable **Use Staging** for testing (no real certificates)
6. Click **Request Certificate**
7. Wait for validation (seconds to minutes)
8. **Restart ReadyStackGo**

:::note[Port 80 forwarding]
If you use a reverse proxy, it must forward port 80 to ReadyStackGo for the HTTP-01 challenge to work.
:::

### Step-by-step: DNS-01 Challenge (Manual)

This method requires manual creation of DNS records but also works for wildcard domains.

1. Navigate to **Settings → TLS / Certificates**
2. Click **Configure Certificate**
3. Select **Let's Encrypt**
4. Enter the following data:
   - **Domains:** Your domain(s), e.g., `*.example.com`
   - **Email:** For expiration notifications
   - **Challenge Type:** DNS-01
   - **DNS Provider:** Manual
5. Click **Request Certificate**
6. The UI shows you the required TXT records:

```
Name: _acme-challenge.example.com
Value: abc123xyz...
```

7. Create the TXT record at your DNS provider
8. Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 24 hours)
9. Click **Confirm DNS Challenge**
10. **Restart ReadyStackGo**

### Step-by-step: DNS-01 Challenge (Cloudflare)

With Cloudflare, DNS records are automatically created and deleted.

1. Create a Cloudflare API token:
   - Go to [Cloudflare Dashboard → Profile → API Tokens](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens)
   - Click **Create Token**
   - Select **Edit zone DNS** as template
   - Restrict to your zone
   - Copy the token

2. Navigate to **Settings → TLS / Certificates**
3. Click **Configure Certificate**
4. Select **Let's Encrypt**
5. Enter the following data:
   - **Domains:** Your domain(s)
   - **Email:** For expiration notifications
   - **Challenge Type:** DNS-01
   - **DNS Provider:** Cloudflare
   - **Cloudflare API Token:** The copied token
   - **Cloudflare Zone ID:** (Optional) Found in Cloudflare Dashboard under Overview
6. Click **Request Certificate**
7. **Restart ReadyStackGo**

### Automatic Renewal

ReadyStackGo automatically renews Let's Encrypt certificates:

- **Check interval:** Every 12 hours
- **Renewal:** 30 days before expiration
- **Status:** Visible under Settings → TLS

If automatic renewal fails:
1. Check the error under **Settings → TLS**
2. Ensure the challenge still works
3. For DNS-01 Manual: Create the new TXT record

### Staging vs. Production

Let's Encrypt has strict rate limits for production certificates. For testing:

1. Enable **Use Staging**
2. Test the complete configuration
3. Staging certificates are not trusted by browsers (warning)
4. Disable staging for the real certificate
5. Request a new certificate

---

## Reverse Proxy Configuration

### When to use?

When ReadyStackGo runs behind an edge proxy:

- **nginx** as reverse proxy
- **Traefik** for container routing
- **HAProxy** for load balancing
- **Cloud Load Balancers** (AWS ALB, Azure App Gateway, etc.)

### SSL Handling Modes

ReadyStackGo supports three modes for SSL communication with the proxy:

#### SSL Termination

```
Client ──HTTPS──► Proxy ──HTTP──► ReadyStackGo
```

**Description:**
- The proxy terminates SSL and decrypts the traffic
- ReadyStackGo receives unencrypted HTTP traffic
- ReadyStackGo does **not** need a certificate

**When to use:**
- Proxy manages all certificates (e.g., Traefik with Let's Encrypt)
- Simplest configuration
- Internal connection (proxy and ReadyStackGo in the same network)

**Configuration:**

1. Navigate to **Settings → TLS / Certificates**
2. Enable **Reverse Proxy Mode**
3. Select **SSL Termination**
4. **Restart ReadyStackGo**

**Nginx Example:**
```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name rsgo.example.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/cert.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/key.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://readystackgo:8080;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;
    }
}
```

#### SSL Passthrough

```
Client ──HTTPS──► Proxy ──HTTPS──► ReadyStackGo
        (encrypted passthrough)
```

**Description:**
- The proxy forwards encrypted traffic unchanged
- ReadyStackGo terminates SSL
- ReadyStackGo **requires** a certificate

**When to use:**
- End-to-end encryption required
- ReadyStackGo manages its own certificate
- Layer 4 load balancing (TCP proxy)

**Configuration:**

1. Configure a certificate in ReadyStackGo (self-signed, custom, or Let's Encrypt)
2. Navigate to **Settings → TLS / Certificates**
3. Enable **Reverse Proxy Mode**
4. Select **SSL Passthrough**
5. **Restart ReadyStackGo**

**Nginx Example (Stream Module):**
```nginx
stream {
    upstream readystackgo {
        server readystackgo:8443;
    }

    server {
        listen 443;
        proxy_pass readystackgo;
    }
}
```

**Traefik Example:**
```yaml
# traefik.yml
entryPoints:
  websecure:
    address: ":443"

# Dynamic config
tcp:
  routers:
    rsgo:
      rule: "HostSNI(`rsgo.example.com`)"
      service: rsgo
      tls:
        passthrough: true
  services:
    rsgo:
      loadBalancer:
        servers:
          - address: "readystackgo:8443"
```

#### Re-Encryption

```
Client ──HTTPS──► Proxy ──HTTPS──► ReadyStackGo
        (terminated)    (re-encrypted)
```

**Description:**
- The proxy terminates the client SSL connection
- The proxy creates a new SSL connection to ReadyStackGo
- Both sides need certificates

**When to use:**
- Compliance requires encrypted internal connections
- Zero-trust network
- Proxy and ReadyStackGo in different network segments

**Configuration:**

1. Configure a certificate in ReadyStackGo
2. Navigate to **Settings → TLS / Certificates**
3. Enable **Reverse Proxy Mode**
4. Select **Re-Encryption**
5. **Restart ReadyStackGo**

:::tip[Self-signed for backend]
With Re-Encryption, a self-signed certificate for ReadyStackGo is often sufficient since only the proxy needs to validate it. Configure the proxy to trust the backend certificate.
:::

**Nginx Example:**
```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name rsgo.example.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/cert.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/key.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass https://readystackgo:8443;
        proxy_ssl_verify off;  # For self-signed backend certificate
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;
    }
}
```

### Forwarded Headers

With SSL Termination and Re-Encryption, ReadyStackGo automatically processes X-Forwarded-* headers:

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `X-Forwarded-For` | Real client IP (important for logs and rate limiting) |
| `X-Forwarded-Proto` | Original protocol (http/https) for correct redirects |
| `X-Forwarded-Host` | Original hostname for URL generation |

These headers are automatically trusted when reverse proxy mode is enabled.

:::caution[Security note]
Only enable reverse proxy mode if ReadyStackGo is actually behind a proxy. With direct internet access, spoofed headers can lead to security issues.
:::

### SSL Mode Comparison Table

| Aspect | SSL Termination | SSL Passthrough | Re-Encryption |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Certificate in ReadyStackGo | Not needed | Required | Required |
| Proxy certificate | Required | Not needed | Required |
| Traffic to backend | HTTP | HTTPS | HTTPS |
| Forwarded Headers | Yes | No | Yes |
| Proxy can read traffic | Yes | No | Yes |
| Configuration complexity | Low | Medium | Medium |

---

## Enable/Disable HTTP Port

ReadyStackGo can optionally also serve HTTP (unencrypted):

1. Navigate to **Settings → TLS / Certificates**
2. Enable or disable **HTTP Enabled**
3. **Restart ReadyStackGo**

:::note[HTTPS Redirect]
When HTTP is enabled, requests to HTTP are automatically redirected to HTTPS - except in SSL Termination mode where backend traffic is already HTTP.
:::

---

## Troubleshooting

### Certificate is not loaded

**Problem:** After upload, the old certificate is still shown.

**Solution:** ReadyStackGo must be restarted for the new certificate to be loaded.

### Let's Encrypt fails

**Problem:** "Failed to validate domain"

**Possible causes:**
1. **HTTP-01:** Port 80 not reachable
2. **DNS-01:** TXT record not created or not yet propagated
3. **Domain not pointing to server:** Check DNS record

**Debug steps:**
1. Check the error under Settings → TLS
2. Test port 80 reachability: `curl http://yourdomain.com/.well-known/acme-challenge/test`
3. Check DNS: `dig TXT _acme-challenge.yourdomain.com`

### Browser shows security warning

**With self-signed certificate:** Expected. Use Let's Encrypt or a CA certificate for production.

**With Let's Encrypt:** Check if you're in staging mode. Staging certificates are not trusted.

### Proxy gets "Connection refused"

**Problem:** The reverse proxy cannot reach ReadyStackGo.

**Check:**
1. Is ReadyStackGo running? `docker ps`
2. Correct port? HTTP = 8080, HTTPS = 8443
3. Network connectivity? `docker network ls`
